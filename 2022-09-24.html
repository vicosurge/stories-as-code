<p>There is no clear order in things, we have forced itself upon things that work fine on their own.</p>
<p>But that does not mean that chaos is in itself everything that is around us, we put order into things so that we can make out what is happening here and there.</p>
<p>Does this make sense? Maybe, this is just an idea of how things work in our society, but understandably this does not open a space for us to better understand reality around us, we are making things more complicated just from trying to define what is that which is in front of us.</p>
<h2 id="enough-of-that">Enough of that</h2>
<p>This is both an idea, a setting and a story, with or without characters that we may identify or make ourselves relatable to.</p>
<p>In 1919 the world is yet to find order, a World War has completely decimated nations in Europe and redefined what we know as nations, cultures and in the long run will also fuel rivalries that will trigger into the next event.</p>
<p>For now we concentrate on the catastrophe that has been triggered and how everyone is trying to put order into things, or attempting to at least.</p>
<p>The Weimar republic is failing in its current state, while it will continue to live on shortly it is still solving issues that had been kept secret for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Rumors existed of <strong>Death Factories</strong>, which the government denied existing.</p>
<p>Their reality is much more complicated than being or not being, it is the involvement of certain groups that made the intent real.</p>
<p>The factories are not looking to kill or purge, instead they are trying to understand how to put the dead back into a living state to create a new breed of soldiers that can withstand the hardships of a new kind of war.</p>
<p>It has eluded science, how can death be evaded or in a way prevented, but another answer that came to mind was: <strong>How can we take advantage of death?</strong></p>
<p>Delving into the macabre arts of necromancy and magic is not an issue for minds ready to cross the veil imposed onto them, breaking through the ideas of science and logic.</p>
<p><strong>The Orange Bureau</strong>, having become aware of this throughout the war, primarily through incidents related to the <strong>Missing Batallion</strong>, the investigations proceeded and reached to the conclusion that the <strong>Silver Tree</strong> was involved.</p>
<p>The results of the investigations may vary but there is a location that <strong>Ishmael Gambeson</strong> has identified where outside members of the Bureau travel to for verification.</p>
