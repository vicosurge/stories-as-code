There are gaps in the blinds at work; it’s a view into another world, when 
people walk past the gap you never see them go past the next. Maybe the gaps 
let you see people who never made it past the first hurdle, they’re the ones 
you lose sight off. Perhaps the gap is there to remind us of those people or 
perhaps they just cross the road, and get hit by a car.

I try not to look through the gaps anymore, it doesn’t show you anything you 
actually want to see, it only gives you a glimpse of what might have been and 
then it’s gone behind the next blind.
