A dream with a cyberpunk rat, literally.

## Dream

We are at an old motel in a relatively small city, we are working with the
mythbusters to figure out something related to cars or the motel itself.

While there some people come in and steal the cars, I had seen them
originally and they looked suspicious but didn't think too much about it as
the town itself was rather shady.

Eventually we got one of the persons who was trying to steal one of the
remaining cars, she had taken forever because she could not take her eyes
off a smartphone and kept replying.

After that the brothers began interrogating her, I went to sleep and while
I was half-asleep I noticed a dead rat on the wall, eventually it fell down
on the bed and I grabbed it, I noticed it was a very small mice.

On closer inspection this mice was genetically and cyber enhanced, it
looked like a monstrosity but was not powerful enough to get out of my
grip.

I took the rat to the brothers so we could begin investigating what the hell was
going on with such a rat.
