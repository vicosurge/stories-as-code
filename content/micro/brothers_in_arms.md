We are brothers in arms

We leave no one behind

We fight for one cause

But a question remains

Will we die all together?

Or will we wait for our time?



I wish I knew you better

So close and so distant

Afraid to make the simplest question

The one that will tear me apart

I can't take the pressure no more

If I asked you, would you kill me now?
