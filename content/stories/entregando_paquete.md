summary: "Scott Navarro acepta una misión que lo lleva al corazón de una logia abandonada en calle primera, donde fuerzas astrales y vampíricas aún resguardan un libro ceremonial. Lo que empieza como una entrega termina revelando secretos sobre la guerra entre Atlantis y Mu, entidades interdimensionales y una conspiración masónica de más de 47 años atrapada en el plano. El paquete no era lo importante: lo que despertó al abrirlo sí lo es."

**"Here."** Scott Navarro dropped a brown packaged box over a pile of papers after he couldn't figure out where to put it on the desk. Piles of paper and books littered most of the surface, with a yellowed CRT monitor barely having any space to breathe.

**"Have the decency to knock and ask first,"** replied Cabeza de Vaca, who observed the dilapidated CRT monitor with intrigue. He turned his attention slowly toward Navarro and noticed first the small cloud of cigarette smoke, then two cigarettes hanging from Navarro's left fingers.  
**"Didn't you see the fucking signs? *Jesus Christ.*"**

**"What, this?"** Navarro pointed at the two cigarettes resting between his left index and middle fingers. He grunted, then dropped them on the floor and crushed them with his left shoe.  
**"There."**

**"Outside, *pendejo.* You're going to stink up the whole place,"** Cabeza de Vaca rolled his eyes and sighed as Navarro shrugged, giving him a facial expression that he could care less about.  
**"This is an institute dedicated to research, not a *pinche congal* like you usually go around in."**

**"Those *pinches congales* you hate so much are the ones that guided me to this."** He pointed at the brown package with his left hand.  
**"And you better pay me right fucking now because I have to pay Ferdinando Tomas."** Navarro slurred and hissed as he spoke the name, raising both hands in the shape of claws.

**"Why does a vampire need money so urgently?"** Cabeza de Vaca looked at the door and motioned Navarro to close it. Navarro closed the door violently with a loud thud and took a seat in the only available chair not overflowing with papers.  
**"It was true all along?"**

**"What?"** Navarro asked as he instinctively looked for his pack of cigarettes. He took two out, then remembered he had just crushed his last pair at Cabeza de Vaca's request. He returned the pack to his pocket and threw the lighter over a couple of papers. Seeing this, Cabeza de Vaca took out an aluminum can cut in half and placed it over what he considered the least important documents, then quickly opened the large window behind him—barred as if it were a prison. The only exit was the door Navarro had just walked through.  
**"You have some?"**

**"Not cold enough though,"** Cabeza de Vaca whispered as he ducked beneath his desk and removed the cover from the side of his computer. Inside were two red cans of Tecate. He took both out and gave one to Navarro, who did not hesitate to open it and light up another pair of cigarettes. Cabeza de Vaca followed by grabbing a cigarette and opening his own can of beer.  
**"Salud."**

As they clashed their beer cans, they drank as if they hadn’t had water for days. Navarro let go of his can with a long burp and sighed with satisfaction.

**"He was right though. I shouldn’t have doubted him when he told me it was in the Lodge over *calle primera,*"** said Navarro. Cabeza de Vaca nearly choked on his cigarette drag and looked both intrigued and surprised.

**"*Pinche loco,* you really did go that far for me?"** Cabeza de Vaca clapped and laughed, passing his right hand over the box. It had been wrapped with an old brown paper bag and duct tape. It could’ve been anything, but Navarro had never played him wrong.

**"Not just for you. I went out of simple curiosity, and there’s no fucking lie about the cat though—he died out of fucking curiosity."** Navarro took another sip from his beer and instinctively set it beneath him, hiding it from plain view. *Because people rarely look below them, that’s why they die in the fucking movies,* he thought, remembering the many times he'd almost been caught back in high school.

**"But you are not dead, Navarro,"** said Cabeza de Vaca jokingly.

**"I’m not a fucking cat. And I have a gun. A big gun."** Navarro replied before taking a long drag from his cigarette.

**"*Ah qué mamón eres,*"** Cabeza de Vaca lowered his head. As hard as he tried, he couldn’t stop the laughter that comment had produced—it sounded more like a sickly phlegmatic giggle than actual laughter, which had always disgusted Navarro.

**"But in all seriousness, Ferdinando wasn’t fucking around. Vampires—bad business, period. Freemason vampires? Forget about it."** Navarro shivered and grimaced at the thought.  
**"I didn’t know vampires could be Brothers."**

**"I'm not surprised. Rumors in the Brotherhood have always floated around about a select group that the Council of the 33rd Degree had—or has—aside from the Strike Team."** Cabeza de Vaca remained silent for a moment, lost in thoughts about some kind of vampire army.  
**"It's the perfect solution if you think about it. But I would assume it to be quite unstable unless they had a really big, tough, and short leash to keep them in check."**

**"Maybe that’s why they freaked the fuck out when I walked into the Lodge in plain daylight."** Navarro made a straight-line motion with his right arm.  
**"Not that it helped me much, but I had a clear path from the main doorway onto the hallway and the pillars."**

**"Was it open, just like that?"**

**"The Lodge? Of course it was open. Why would it be closed?"** Navarro took another sip of his beer and continued to chain-smoke.  
**"And it’s been open for a long time. I could feel it. That rift is big, *pero cabrón,* and I could feel it going really low."**

**"Years? Decades?"** Cabeza de Vaca took a drag from his cigarette as he saw Navarro squint his left eye, grunting—hesitating on the answer.

**"Decades. Probably even centuries. It felt like my soul was going to be sucked into it if I had crossed the pillars."** Navarro fell silent as he recalled what had transpired.
