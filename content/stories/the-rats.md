It was through the old streets of Jerusalem, at night, with trembling torches 
in one hand, the other at the ready to draw for the threat of Saladin was near.

The night stood quiet, too quiet, the wind from time to time hit the patrol 
tenderly but every time it felt as if a knife was crossing through their skin, 
that they had been betrayed by their senses and their death had finally arrived, 
unnoticed.

None of this had happened so far, the weeks at night quiet but tense and even 
more during the day with everyone waiting for the dreaded strike, the patrols 
doubled and tripled, men pushed to the brink by the horror of a full scale 
attack, how would they fare, how long could they survive, how horrible would 
be their death, some had come to bet on the situation, the money had been 
hidden in a reservoir, at the bottom inside a small iron box, for the survivors 
to live off from it as an insurance, others would drink it all away and hope 
for the best, or the worst.

Throughout the dead streets they heard their own footsteps, always wary of the 
direction the sound came from it never ceased to stress them, their armor 
crunching and ripping, leather and metal in clash, the torches cracking slowly 
and if they stood quiet long enough not only could they hear their breathing, 
their heartbeat throbbed hard on their ears, almost on their necks, fast.

It wasn't long for them to find an oddity in the streets, a man lay dead, at 
first they stood in shock at the visage, then rapidly attended the body to find 
the culprit, their failure to rapidly grasp what was happening led them to 
their doom.

Rats, rushing out of the shadows in the hundreds, silently awaiting for their 
next pray, screams of panic and warning were followed by those of pain and 
horror, the torches did little to put them out of harms way, swords ineffective 
with such small targets even in the quantities present they seemed well aware 
of their intentions and evaded easily, their armors useless as the rodents flew 
towards their face and any openings between legs, arms or chest, no flesh left 
to tear, no bones left to gnaw, the metal and leather turn to pieces or taken 
away by the wave, the torches only a few splinters now, nothing remained save 
for the infusion of terror that the surrounding inhabitants had to live with 
every night, pray the next victims were not them.
