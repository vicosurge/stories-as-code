# Tech Men II: Everyday’s Work

## 🛐 The Arrival

"The Cathedral" — Engineer Solomon Sanchez looked up at the magnanimous Gothic structure. Built during the Dark Ages by fervent believers in God, it now stood as a monument to faith. But to the Tech Men? Just another building. Another congregation. Its only relevance: housing a few ancient machines they serviced from time to time.

Approaching the Cathedral drew attention from the Law Men. He couldn’t tell if they were military or police—the uniforms had been standardized long ago. Still, none stopped him. The robes of the Tech Men opened many doors… and closed a few, thanks to old feuds and childish vendettas from the dawn of the tech boom.

> “Greetings, do you come to the congregation?”  
> A monk in brown robes didn’t recognize him at first—until he noticed the colors and emblem on Solomon’s bag.  
> “Ah! Welcome, great holder of knowledge. This way, please.”

They always bowed. They kneeled. As if he were nobility or sanctity. But he was a simple man with only knowledge—no more power than the monk now guiding him.

## 📚 The Library of Lost Circuits

The echo of Sanchez’s boots contrasted with the monk’s sandal flaps. He was led to the mouth of a grand library where monks studied aged texts in silence. Each table held three terminals connected to modest local servers.

> “Engineer Sanchez,” called a voice from the far side.  
> The congregation stood, bowed toward him.  
> “Welcome.”

> “Bishop McCay.”  
Solomon nodded—a formality they both understood. Seven years they had worked together, yet he had been summoned here only twice. Something was different now.

> “Where is the ailing machine?”

> “Brother Nellus, take the Engineer.”

## ⚙️ The Machine

Four conventional computers sat on a table. Legacy servers, no doubt. Solomon frowned.

He had studied Legacy Hardware for seven years. He’d revived systems pulled from sewers, rebuilt machines from scratch, and witnessed bizarre tech veneration—gold plating, dressing machines like gods. It never made sense.

These particular units were adorned with candles and incense. One was burned by a candle—the reason he was summoned. Dust and ash coated the cases. He wiped the surface with a gloved hand. The smell: decay and wildflowers.

> “Clean them weekly. Daily, if you insist on incense.  
> No warm objects. No flames. No liquids. No melting wax.”  
He didn't bother turning around. They would understand.

He shifted a chair and looked for the service tag, then retrieved an old book from his bag. On its cover: the Cross of Technology—a white Triskelion representing man's constant evolution.

> “Great one, what is that book?” asked Brother Nellus, offering a lantern.

> “It holds records. This machine’s history in particular.”

## 🧠 Diagnosis

The book’s pages were archaic—brittle with age. Finding the tag code, Solomon sighed in relief… then concern.

> “Pre-Y2K. Custom-made… oh… curses.”

That meant chaos. This was pre-standardization. Machines from this era belonged to the time before UNIX 2032’s cataclysm—U32. A disaster born from the negligence of the Gurus.

> “Is it bad news, Great Master?” asked Bishop McCay.

> “Maybe.”

From his bag he drew a blessed LCD screen—crafted by the Mechanical Engineers of the 4th Office. Plugging it in revealed only red and purple static. Restarting removed the lines, but the machine remained semi-dead, producing faint whirs and a recurring *TAK TAK*.

Power cycling—his go-to sacred technique—failed.

> “Time to disassemble.”

He removed the cables like a priest unplugging life support.

> “G-Great one, sorry to interrupt,” Brother Nellus pleaded.  
> “Would you not be… killing the machine?”

> “No, Brother. It sleeps before disconnection. It will not die.”

## 🛐 Revelation and Ruin

An empty table was cleared. With reverence, Solomon unscrewed the case—rusted screws giving way to chaos. A jungle of old cables. The candle had burned the casing, melted wires, scorched the motherboard. And the dust… so much dust, it could be sewn into a new robe.

> “An unfortunate event has led to the death of this machine.”

He jotted notes in another book. Salvageable pieces. A large red “D” marked the case—designating disposal.

> “I’ll take this back to our shop for proper dismantling.”

> “And our research? Years of data?” asked Bishop McCay.

> “It can be recovered. But I’ll need silence. No distractions in the library.”

> “You may have access during tomorrow’s congregation. We’ll be occupied in the Cathedral. But you’ll be under close watch.”

> “Fair enough. I’ll return shortly.”

> “Will you report to the Master Engineer?”

> “Yes. And request additional tools.”

> “Give him my highest regards.”

> “I will.”

Solomon nodded and stepped out, heading into the grimy, crowded streets of Lincoln—city of wires and whispered prayers.
