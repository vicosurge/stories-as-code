## Introduction to Setting

This document contains information about the characters seen during the campaign held in Venice during a period in which it was still flourishing.

## NPC

### Duke Emil of Caen and Duke Rodolfo of Flanders

**Clan:** Unknown | **Position:** Dukes

Emil is one of several brothers who were embraced to sustain power for a dying family, little did they know the mistake of such act.

Emil and his brother Rodolfo were both Sired by the same Kindred, who in turn they diablerized and so they did with others in the region in order to gain power and titles, with a large number of Ghouls under their command it was to no surprise that they managed to also obtain Fiefdoms although the feat by William the Bastard escaped them during their early days, and they do not forgive themselves for letting go of such possessions, they continue to look for ways to expand the power of Paris and France throughout Europe through any means necessary which originally included the death of the Prince of Venice, a long friend of both of them who had also conspired from time to time to get to where they were and in a way was assisted by both brothers to reach Venice, who saw his Final Death before they could put their plan into action.

Due to their actions Emil and Rodolfo have escaped Venice and by political maneuvering are now marked for bloodhunt due to their conspiration to destabilize the Camarilla and murdering the former Prince of Venice, this coupled with previous actions has also put them on a bloodhunt in Paris by the Prince of such Domain, their flight may not save them in time.

Emil has Sired a trader of fine leathers in Venice, a PC for the Campaign, while Rodolfo has a Childer back in his dominion who watches over as he is away, which is most of the time.

### Renee Ferdinand Antoine

**Clan:** Mage | **Position:** Demonologist

Renee is a Mage who finds himself in a troubled position, he became one due to his interest in the Occult and then regretted it the rest of his life, seeing more than the fair share of people die in his short life he has dedicated his life to write about those he wishes not forgotten, including himself, frustrated by his lack of abilities he writes what he can as he does what he must to survive, an admirable alchemist and a mediocre Doctor when no one else is available for the job.

While younger Renee dedicated himself to pickpocketing and lockpicking to survive, this way of life led him to many problems but also to think more about what he wished in life, he did not believe himself capable of attaining a high enough status to survive this life. One of his many adventures led him to discover a book of the Occult, from there on he dedicated to learn and understand more about this venue and eventually found himself in touch with others who shared his interest, in time he was invited to be part of something bigger than him.

Renee is a dedicated Demonologist and his task is to investigate possible uses and abuses of connections with the Devil or other demons, while he does not work with the Church directly or the Inquisition his interest is due to his understanding that the Tremere Clan formed a pact with the devil that delivered the terrible power they hold now.

He is aware about the intentions of the Lasombra of Venice and whilst interested in the Occult he is not one to deal openly with them, earning the wrath of his fellow Mage and Kindred would bring him death fairly quickly. This does not mean he does not wish to do so, simply that he needs to choose how and when with more care than.

### Francesca (Lucretia)

**Clan:** Unknown | **Position:** None

Odo is the only one that truly understands what transpired with her Embrace, she is a twelve year old who was delivered to the Monastery in which he resides in Verona and to his surprise found out that she was a Kindred just as him, he was also surprised to find that she could write, read and understand him perfectly but would not speak to him, throughout the years Francesca, as she calls herself, has been an aide for Odo on situations that he is unable to intervene. Odo is unaware what Clan she is part of and other Kindred do not interact with her, it is hard already to interact with other Kindreds but a Child is not one to be delivered into the World of Darkness for no good reason.

During his tenure as Prince, Odo will come to learn that Francesca, who is also known as Lucretia, was raped by a Kindred and his Ghouls and embraced in what could be considered a spur of the moment, being a survivor of this event she drained one of the ghouls and killed another, from there on she continued to escape until she was found by inhabitants in Verona and taken to Odo. Odo will also come to learn that the Sire of Francesca is a Follower of Set and has a very large group of ghouls and retainers that will assist him in every possible way to continue his task, Francesca does not manifest the disciplines she has not because she does not want to but because she is afraid of the unwillingly earned powers of her Sire.

Francesca made it to Venice after being informed that Odo had moved out from Verona, not wishing to lose contact with him she proceeded to Venice on her own only to find herself lost in the vast city, it was due to player interaction that they found her although by slight accident. Delivering her to Odo and with the help of Emmanuel they managed to understand what happened to her, Odo has made it known that those responsible will be hunted.

### Il-Kim-Yuk

**Clan:** Kuei-jin | **Position:** Eastern Kindred

The mysterious figure known as Il-Kim-Yuk comes from the far east, moving through Otoman lands with ease with an uneasy pressence that drives Kindred and others to quick suspicion.

Almost a ghost, with a porcelain skin that shines under the light of the moon, and with the potential to walk under the sun it is no wonder that Kindred find these "eastern Kindred" to be very deadly and untrustworthy.

While visiting Venice it was through their request that Selina of Agincourt should be delivered on a silver plate to it, having offended them with their pressence in court.

The Ventrue did not hesitate to comply and with this Il-Kim-Yuk knew that it would be with relative ease that they could continue to influence the European Kindred with ease.

### Gangrel

#### Elim

**Clan:** Gangrel | **Position:** None

An inhabitant of the wild since his early life, living with a family dedicated to farming work and rising cattle. It was during one of his adventures on the outside that he found himself followed by a Gangrel who had been keeping an eye on him for some time, the Embrace happened faster than Elim could have noticed and with it a week of confusion and rejection from Childer to Sire.

Elim was torn, he wished to see his family again but finding his Kindred status making this an impossible feat he moved to the city of Venice to his Sire surprise and disappointment. Intrigued by the way of the city and civilization it has been a continuos task to keep educating and growing in the eyes of his fellow Kindred, looking not for acceptance but to be the opposite of what he was forced to be. He walks into the caf√© of the Toreador in order to learn from them and be up to date in city and Camarilla politics.

Story wise Elim was the son of the man who delivered goods to the PC who is the Merchant of Leather of Venice, he may recall him at one point if he sees him and Elim will immediately recognize him.

#### Keeper of Elysium Sigismund

**Clan:** Gangrel | **Position:** Keeper of Elysium

Sigismund is a an ancillae of the Gangrel, a noble person at heart it was a misfortune that was embraced by the Kindred while he was out to hunt, he is a victim of the Sabbat shovelhead tradition and while a survivor of the mass grave he was left confused and without true direction, his family suffered the consequences of him becoming a Kindred and were burned at the stake with Sigismund barely surviving the persecution that followed, from that time on Sigismund has become a nomad and only coming to Venice in recent years, calm and considerate for a Kindred, he is not looked upon kindly but some have mercy on him due to his unfortunate past.

By decision of Odo he was made Keeper of Elysium, while this position has brought him considerable power he has decided to continue serving at the doors of Elysium as well as pretending the title is nothing more than a new prefix added to his name, just to avoid it getting to him.

### Nosferatu

#### Primogen Bel Antonio de Florence

**Clan:** Nosferatu | **Position:** Primogen

Bel is an old Nosferatu, so old sometimes talks about Venice before the channels and structures were present but most tend to ignore this or call it off as something he has made up on his own, most Nosferatu are aware he is old but they also assume he is not that old to be awake and walking. Bel remembers Rabbat, Rabbat remembers Bel, Bel has helped her to avoid the wrath of the Camarilla for longer than he should have and he knows it with most Nosferatu beginning to suspect something about it, the Masquerade may break sooner than later for his indiscretion.

#### Deputy Armand

**Clan:** Nosferatu | **Position:** Deputy

A relatively old Neonate, inside the 70 year mark, who behaves properly and spends his time with the Toreador, he also trades important information, at least for them, in regards to the events around the city and Kindred society in general but he also delivers important information when necessary aside from the usual mark.

By decision of the Seneschal and the Sheriff, Armand was assigned to a team of Deputies in charge of assisting with the investigation and execution of the Camarilla laws, he has proven to be a reliable Kindred, either by himself or the rats he handles, strong and intelligent although his odor caused the PC party to go through problems in the past.

He is also under protection by Ricardo, few know about Armands homosexual tendencies and some of the few who know are looking to bring him to his Final Death.

### Toreador

#### Prince Odo, the Bishop of Verona, Cardinal of Venice

**Clan:** Toreador | **Position:** Prince of Venice, Cardinal of Venice, Bishop of Verona

Odo is a Toreador that has lived since the Middle Ages, he comes from a lowborn background and fought his way up, during his mortal life he became aware of the Kindred by accident by helping a Nosferatu who he thought was a leper, later on he would continue to assist the Nosferatu as he served as a Clergyman for the Church trying to repent for his bloodshed during the 1st Crusade as he never accepted it as a form of redemption in the eyes of God, to him all are equal to God and the amount of blood shed can in no way or form please such a God. Odo was embraced in his mid-thirties by a Toreador who considered him an excellent asset for their Clan as Odo, while a Clergyman, had considerable good taste and was a safe keeper and patron of the Arts when he could afford such a thing.

Odo is fair but cruel with Humans in general, he sees them no as no more than cattle and as broken vessels who deserve nothing but the full wrath of God for their little to no understanding of the reality of life, he does not share this feeling with his fellow Kindred as the Camarilla has showed him that certain restrain is possible and thus despises the Sabbath line of thought and anyone working directly with them.

Odo has a long standing feud with some of the NPCs showed during the campaign, Emil of Caen and Rodolfo of Flanders are two prime examples, the former Prince Alberto of Venice was another example as he lived in pure excess and rampant luxury Odo decided not to present himself to court even when the Prince himself demanded such a thing.

Maximilian Ferdinand of Cologne stands in a middle ground with Odo and so do the Giovanni who keep their claim of Venice and have demanded for the Camarilla and Sabbat to stop their incursions in Venice, specially through the Promise of 1528 (keyword: Promise) that the Camarilla and the Giovanni accorded. Califas of Athens is another Kindred, a Malkavian, with whom he has a middle grounded stance, while he does not treat them as others would he is not found of him, he needs him even if his predictions are esoteric and hardly ever make sense to the Kindred around him but nonetheless Odo has found that the prediction of Venice burning in at least 100 years is a probable accurate prediction with the way things are going.

He is in considerable good standing with the Nosferatu of Venice through their Primogen Bel Antonio de Florence and with his long-time friend Ricardo de Castilla. Odo is in such good standing because he saved a Nosferatu during his time as Priest thinking he was a leper, later on he was informed of what the Kindred were and their curse, from there on Odo searched for a way to help the Kindred redeem and go with God but seeing his life was already at the end of its leash he turned to a Toreador which embraced him to allow him to continue his work as a Kindred.

While this surprised many who knew him the Nosferatu were openly shocked by his decision, not that they wished to embrace him but were disappointed that they did not follow the warning provided by them in regards to Kindred society.

Odo has previously been in the first Crusade with Ricardo but renounced the supposed salvation this could have brought him as the bloodshed disgusted him and considered it not to be the proper way to be in the good side of God, thus he turned to the Church to find salvation and help others also find salvation although disappointment reached him during his unlife as he understood the true ways of the Vatican and who really controls the power behind the scene.

He and Ricardo have a long history, while they were both there for each other Odo has never forgiven himself for not being able to help his best friend in his time of most need and although Odo stood with the Camarilla and Ricardo went with the Sabbat it was the latter that decided to return to the Camarilla in order to be with his best friend and also it was Odo who assisted him during this time in which no one would trust him.

At this point Odo stands as the legitimate Prince of Venice due to the untimely and horrible death of former Prince Alberto of Venice, he does so by having a charter provided to him by the Nosferatu who had kept it under their watch for the last 300 years that the Camarilla had continuously seen Princes change inside Venice. Odo has also sent to Rome his letter asking for a position as Cardinal. Odo had also Sired a Kindred a week prior to the events that unfolded, his Childer is a PC of this Campaign.

#### Primogen Thomas Tornelli (Toto)

**Clan:** Toreador | **Position:** Primogen

Thomas Tornelli was in love with her Wife during their mortal life, they both performed Theater and he wrote their lines, poetry and declaimed, they were the perfect couple until unlife led both to the Toreador, with an eternity in front of them Thomas, known by most as Toto, became frustrated and pulled into idleness and eventually politics.

By order of the Prince he had to take the unlife of her Wife and has now become an embittered Primogen who has to take over what Odo left for him.

#### Lucius Quintus Scipio (Fabriccio)

**Clan:** Toreador | **Position:** None

Quintus, as referred to by fellow Toreador, is a man with true potential in regards to drawing and designing, a fanatic of numbers and equations, he indulges in simple vices just to keep his mind entertained and avoid taking suicide into consideration again. He works odd jobs throughout Venice, he may produce a sketch for someone in the street and just give it to them for free, he may make the design for a house and rip it apart, he may make a map just to learn the name of cities and towns, whatever fits the moment is what he does if he ever finds what fits the moment.

Quintus has established a relation with a PC to create a sort of house for designers, taking to life some of his designs for the first time ever which has drawn approval from the local Toreador, specially since he has been given a formal job by the PC as his designed for leather.

After Quintus learned that the Osprey, Duke of Orleans, was in Venice he decided to make flight back to Paris while apologizing to the rest of the Toreador in the city.

#### Maria de Bordeaux

**Clan:** Toreador | **Position:** None (Final Death)

Maria is a lover of music and musicians, she has met her Final Death at the hands of her husband, Thomas Tornelli, in 1714 by the order of the Prince of Venice for breaking the Third Tradition. Maria was embraced at the same time as her Husband, both worked performing Theater and when able Maria would sign Opera but the struggle to bring his Husband to stage, her inspiration, killed her love for him eventually and in the later years they reached an estranged relationship where they tolerated each other for their common bond to the Toreador.

#### Master Antonio Marcollini

**Clan:** Toreador | **Position:** Master Artist

Master Marcollini is a Toreador who learned from Veroccio a few years prior to DaVinci becoming an apprentice of the same Master, the difference being that Marcollini was not interested in all the different fields that DaVinci had gotten into and worked to get a deeper anatomical understanding to work on sculptures rather than painting, throughout the centuries he worked his way through this and established a workshop which he keeps open to anyone who wishes to learn at no cost, his desire to put art in the hands of everyone has taken him to extreme extents from losing everything to getting in problems, his desire to paint and sculpt the naked body has put him also in the eye of the Church more than once but Odo has saved him more than once from any possible seizures or reprisals.

#### Anselmo, the Violin Maker

**Clan:** Toreador | **Position:** Craftsman

Embraced by Maria de Bordeaux in a fit of rage and emotions, he has been allowed to continue to live by permission of the Prince of Venice and has had Thomas Tornelli assigned as his Mentor.

Anselmo is obsessed with his line of work, he will not stop until he makes the perfect instrument for each and every one of his customers if he considers it so, it is not so much about the money that he does this for but the sound, the music, something enthralls him to the point of obsession and he will not rest until he comes up with the perfect instrument, the sublime is little to what he really wants.

#### Osprey, Duke of Orleans

**Clan:** Toreador | **Position:** Duke of Orleans (Sabbat)

The Duke of Orleans has been there since the beginning of France, he is the figure responsible for bringing the entirety of France into what it is now today, through political intrigue and manipulation he has managed to push a squabbling nation into one of the main players of the current politics of Europe and the world.

This has not come without consequences, Osprey, while a Toreador, did not envision the Camarilla as the answer the Kindred needed for their situation, specially since he had conspired for the Church to burn some of his enemies.

Making the obvious jump Osprey went to the Sabbat were he figured he could earn the respect and power he deserved, having earned little power yet plenty of recognition for what he had achieved.

The Sabbat was indifferent to what Osprey had performed, he had to not only prove himself to them but also help them fight the Camarilla and the Jyhad, which Osprey suspected was more of a way to keep things under control than an actual fight, a fight against Elders and things he had never seen but in a way had felt throughout his time in France.

In Venice he is looking to prove himself by putting the Sabbat in control of the city or die in the process, he has gone through enough to fail, going to the Camarilla would probably earn him a quick death and going back to the Sabbat empty handed would mean becoming the play thing of a Tzimisce.

### Giovanni

#### Ambrosio Giovanni

**Clan:** Giovanni (Human) | **Position:** Paterfamilias (Human side)

The current paterfamilias of the human side of the Giovanni family. A ruthless asshole that while subtle lacks true command if it were not for his son Donatello who is his direct enforcer in many of the Giovanni family matters.

Old enough to die soon, a late bloomer also in family matters but his promiscuity and bastard children would like him to take care of them instead of just having a lust for his own daughters, specially Antonieta.

#### Donatello Giovanni

**Clan:** Giovanni (Human) | **Position:** Next Paterfamilias

The next in line for the position of paterfamilias, as ruthless if not more than his father but an agile mind and enough contacts to make him the right choice, he has an incestuous relation with her Aunt and has produced three offspring from this relationship, she is as ruthless as him but has more tact and is better at diplomatic conversations.

As his father he has an obsession with his sisters and lusts for Antonieta with passion, the only reason he has not made a move is because he does not wish to bring the wrath of the Kindred side of the family onto himself.

#### Grigorio Giovanni

**Clan:** Giovanni | **Position:** Enforcer

If Donatello is the enforcer of his father then Grigorio is the enforcer of Donatello, a brute yet smart enough to know his Kindred power are limited yet he abuses them when confronting anyone, he cares little for the Camarilla and Sabbat and makes open threats to them without understanding the real consequences of his actions.

#### Antonieta Giovanni

**Clan:** Giovanni (Human, Proxy Kiss) | **Position:** Family Jewel

The current jewel of the human Giovanni family, smart, charming, a patron of the arts, diplomatic and easy going, she is trapped most of the time in the family estate and looks toward freedom through any means, even if it means receiving the Embrace. She has already received the Proxy Kiss and is well versed in Kindred terminology, she is not an avid practitioner of the Necromantic tradition of the family but is able to perform better than most of the Human side of the family.

By order of the Kindred side of the family she is never to be touched in any way or form and to be given a certain degree of freedom from other Giovanni affairs that do not yet concern her. A lover of music she is fascinated about having found a young musician, a PC Toreador, who has melted her heart and has gone as far as to declare her love to him in a subtle way and convinced her Father to allow him to play for them inside the estate.

### Brujah

#### Clemens Antonio of Mantua

**Clan:** Brujah | **Position:** Arsenal Worker

Clemens is a Brujah born into conflict, his embrace performed as he was dying in the battlefield, his tenure as a kindred has been nothing but struggle with more blood than the usual Camarilla Kindred would need or want, short-tempered and violent at the minor provocation he fit proper into the Brujah and been into conflict with Ventrue due to their ill-judgement on most affairs concerning the safety of the Camarilla and the battle against the Sabbat.

In Venice he has become part of the network of Arsenals of Venice where he works diligently for the safety of the city.

#### Captain Rigoberto di Formo

**Clan:** Brujah | **Position:** Captain of the Guard

Rigoberto is one of the Captains of the Guard of Venice who works during the long hours of the night ensuring that the peace and serenity of the Republic of Venice is held in proper order, he is by nature a very fierce combatant and very able to crush with his own hands anything that comes his way. He went into Torpor for a week due to a stake on his heart and came back not knowing what has happened to him.

While investigating a crime committed against a ghoul belonging to the Primogen of the Brujah he had gathered enough evidence to loot and burn the house and everyone inside as ordered by the Doge of Venice, this not only has caused tension between Prince Odo and the Giovanni, who have temporally delivered Venice to Odo to enforce the Masquerade, but also between the Giovanni and Brujah who seem to have bought the Captain.

### Ventrue

#### Former Prince Alberto of Venice

**Clan:** Ventrue | **Position:** Former Prince (Final Death)

The Former Prince Alberto loved to live in excess and with everything always pointing towards him, be it good or bad. While in Paris he lived through the court unnoticed, considered a buffoon, incapable of political or economic ambition, too self-centered to even care about doing anything other than praise himself.

This made him an easy puppet or so most thought until placed by the court of Paris in the chair of Venice, it is widely believed that the reason why the Camarilla has not been able to place itself in power inside Venice was because of the former Prince, also the fact that the court of Venice had to pay tribute to the Giovanni caused an outrageous response from other courts Europe.

His final death came to him whilst court was in session, an assassin came to him and ensured that the Sun met his final death.

#### Primogen Angelo di Strada

**Clan:** Ventrue | **Position:** Primogen, Former Seneschal

The current Primogen of the Ventrue, the second richest man of Venice and the former Seneschal of Venice, he is an ambitious and ruthless Kindred yet he is eluded by Odo and the Toreador who have finally come to power to put him in place.

#### Selina de Agincourt

**Clan:** Ventrue | **Position:** Second in Command (Final Death)

The second in command of the Ventrue in Venice, after the Ventrue offered to pay the debt of the former Prince to the Giovanni she declared her departure to Genoa to look for better fortune.

She remained in Venice after the Primogen reassured her that the situation in Venice would be improving she considered staying for a while although this decision would prove to be fatal.

While being visited by the Kuel-Jin Il-Kim-Yuk, who provided them with gold, jade and other goods for them to trade, noticed her in Court and demanded her ashes in a silver plate, the ashes were delivered before the end of the night as the Kuel-Jin had ordered.

#### Celso Brioni

**Clan:** Ventrue | **Position:** Spirit Merchant (Departed)

Celso is a Ventrue that held a considerable control of the sales of strong liquors (spirits) in Venice and the surrounding areas, his immediate departure from Venice drew suspicions from the Primogen and an investigation was carried on by request by the Sheriff, Deputies found in his house a fair collection of items for the Occult and a summoning circle with a relatively fresh Human body inside which could tentatively be the body of a Garrou since they found a pendant with a Garrou fang.

### Lasombra

#### Sheriff Don Ricardo de Castilla

**Clan:** Lasombra Antitribu | **Position:** Sheriff of Venice

Considered by many as an undesirable amongst the Kindred of the Camarilla, a traitor by the Sabbat and non-existent by Lasombra and the Amis de Noir, Ricardo stands with his friend Odo and not with any faction.

While an antitribu he committed many acts of diablerie (Amaranth) throughout his un-life and thus has more aces under his sleeves than most would think or assume, he is resourceful, cunning, has a quick tongue and a quicker hand, fair with his peers as he always remembers where he came from, he has not achieved as much as he would have liked due to the structure of the Camarilla but in the long run he does not mind, he is a dilettante by nature and thus makes many calls on who is and who is not hot, this has earned the disgust of Emmanuel, a "fellow" Lasombra antitribu that holds considerable political and economic power in Venice.

Ricardo, as Odo, are well known throughout Europe and infamous for their antics in the past, they cover for each other when possible and provide when needed, Ricardo has Sired twice through his un-life, the first a young maiden which met her demise rather quickly and left him with a sense of guilt for not being responsible enough, from there on he lost himself to the pleasures and lust of life.

His second Childer has faired better but stands in the Sabbath instead of the Camarilla, Manuel de Cerdena is a Kindred of little renown and more of a hindrance to his Sire than of actual use but in times of needs has proved to be as resourceful as his Sire.

Ricardo works as a father figure for Neonates as he never truly had one when growing up during the middle ages or after being embraced.

#### Father Mario Lozano Matamoros

**Clan:** Lasombra | **Position:** Priest

Mario is, as Odo, a Kindred who has looked upon bringing forth the salvation of humanity and the Kindred in general, as a Lasombra he is of doubtful allegiance to the Camarilla having never formally resigned the Sabbat, although no formal resignation can be done to begin with from such a thing.

Father Mario has known Ricardo for as long as he has been in Venice, around 100 years, and while he has his differences with him he believes that Ricardo has a good heart, is a good Catholic and is not the man that he plays to be rather simply fills the emptiness he perceives with vices and lust.

#### Seneschal Emmanuel de Ponce y Ramirez

**Clan:** Lasombra Antitribu | **Position:** Seneschal

Emmanuel is a Kindred to be recognized and feared, ruthless, calculating, a political and economical powerhouse on his own, owner of a large majority of mercenaries of Venice and of his own island on the outskirts of Venice, controls one of the offices of Venice and owns a personal fleet of twenty boats which he uses to defend and trade around the coast of Italy.

Emmanuel has never trusted the Camarilla Ventrue for being naturally incompetent in his eyes, had it not been the case Venice would not be of the Giovanni and the Giovanni would not exist at all, he does not blame the Sabbat for they never really cared for Venice and are too busy trying to kill anything that moves to even bother with more important things like stopping the Jyhad or obtaining the Fragments in order to understand the truth about Caine.

He does not have a good relationship with the other Lasombra and they do not like him either but stand him because of the magnitude of his power, when he visited Odo to understand what had transpired and how was he ever elected Prince he was informed that the position of Seneschal had been given to him and that his first appearance in Court would be an absolute delight to the Ventrue.

With this Emmanuel has put a small amount of fate in the Camarilla and has become indebted with Odo for the rest of his unlife for this favor, one that he may end up paying costly.

Emmanuel is a practicioner of the Occult long before he joined the ranks of Lasombra, a man of power and knowledge who held large estates both in Italy and what is now Spain, his signature Estate is outside of Venice for good reason, it gives him somewhere to stay away from the rest of the rabble and he can continue to practice and investigate further on

Rumor has it that Emmanuel possesses a large collection of crosses which includes parts of the cross in which Christ was crucified, also rumored that he has in his hands parts of the remains of Saint Peter but Ricardo considers that to be an exaggeration but knowing how Catholic Emmanuel is he does not have any doubt that he could have been scammed out of his beliefs.

### Tremere

#### Primogen Maximilian Ferdinand of Cologne

**Clan:** Tremere | **Position:** Primogen

The Primogen of the Tremere in Venice and one of the oldest Kindred in Venice, Maximilian had worked his way to get the title of Prince of Venice but his maneuvering was stopped by the Primogen and Elders of Venice who warned him that his rule would be as short as Prince Alberto if not shorter since he holds no true Political or Economical power and in the long run the Camarilla does not trust the Tremere enough due to their bound with their own Council.

While upset by the decision he did not question or fight it, he observes from the back of the current scenario to understand something more sinister that is happening in Venice, something that still has not come to fruition.

### Malkavian

#### Califas of Athens

**Clan:** Malkavian | **Position:** Court Jester (Bloodhunt)

Califas is an old Kindred, so old he swears Diogenes of Sinope was his mentor while a Human but this is doubtful since he never had any pupils per say.

Califas is a reasonable Malkavian and speaks truth more often than most Kindred would, most Kindred are also more afraid than disgusted by Califas since he has spoken of also being alive when Antediluvians walked the Earth but this again is seen as another one of his delusions due to his age.

He functions as a sort of Jester in Court now that Odo has reached his position as Prince but his indiscretion has finally reached him with the Ventrue Primogen requesting justice for what has transpired and Odo following with his demands pointing out that Califas is a known Diabolist and Diablerist who has been let go of his crimes due to his service to the Camarilla and surprisingly managing to uphold the Masquerade even when most would not be able to.

Califas will simply move on, it would not be the first or last he does this, a bloodhunt will not put a stop on him and neither will a Justicar.

### Tzimisce

#### The Masked One

**Clan:** Tzimisce | **Position:** Unknown

There is a Tzimisce that has come to Venice, for the carnival and probably to search for something else, Ricardo had the misfortune to find him while travelling with a Tremere in his group and feared for the life of fellow Kindred, not for himself, although this Tzimisce seems to be part of the older section of his clan.

The Masked One has changed beyond human form, he is more an insect, with four mantis like claw spewing from his back, feet with three large toe front and back, visible chest with bones over the muscles and what look like wings on his back, the face is completely white and resembles one of the masks so popular in the carnival that most would dismiss immediately, to cover he wears a body cape and a hat.

### The Fallen

#### Isabelle Anais Faustine (Androlieth)

**Clan:** Fallen | **Position:** Mistress of Seduction

A mistress of seduction and intrigue that works for Madame Eleonora, her thrall, who indulged in chess and cards, she is sometimes cryptic and provides answers that she could not possibly know, she knows of the Kindred and other groups, she is a Fallen that returned during the Renaissance by a curious Occultist who became mad shortly after, she is a Faustian Devil who is looking for the rest of her House through Europe in order to put her grandest plan in motion, one that as a former commander of a Legion may help their brethren trapped in the Abyss.

#### That which is trapped

**Clan:** Fallen | **Position:** Trapped

At the center of Elysium a Fallen has been trapped inside a seal, this creature at this point serves no other purpose but to listen and plan, if someone were to tap into it or try and communicate they may be in for a real surprise.

#### Antonio Bartolomeo Lazaro di Genoa (Lazathiel)

**Clan:** Fallen | **Position:** Merchant of Genoa

A merchant of Genoa who has a fair share of the market of Genoa, he is known to be a ruthless trader and hold a personal army that could currently put the one on Venice to shame, Alberto will come to Genoa personally to put more strain into their situation and personally verify that the Giovanni show some retrain on what they are doing and to learn their place in this century in which Venice is fading.

Lazaro has already tried to tempt the Ventrue PC into his service but he has failed to bring him to his side with power, Lazaro will continue to pursue Kindred of the Camarilla to his side in order to bring them into disarray and for his plans to come into fruition.

Should the players try to challenge or fight Alberto they will find a Fallen of much more power than any of the Kindred in Venice or any Fallen for that matter, Lazathiel is a Fallen who absolutely despises Devils and will go into any extent to absorb them, he will never allow them to go back to the Abyss, he cares little for Kindred and considers them a nuisance which he will remove with easiness if he is bothered. He is a Faustian to the extreme, he has little regards for Humans and will fight to get to God and end the fight that the traitor Lucifer did not finish to sit on the High Throne from which he can supervise the creation of a New World of darkness.
