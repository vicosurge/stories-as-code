The man with the hat and the kid ride Justice to the statue of mother Leucippe, 
a marble statue standing on a large pedestal, standing on her right foot, left 
leg extended back, on her left hand a large piece of cloth with something 
written in it, on her right hand a large spear extended forward as if trying to 
pierce something or someone, her head looking forward with a face of pain and 
wrath, on her left cheek a tear rolling down halfway.

As both got close the man with the hat read the plaque: “Here you find what is 
left of mother Leucippe, mother to all kings and empress of the world. What she 
has given only she can take”

“What does that mean?” Asked the kid at the man with the hat

“What part of it all?” Asked the man with the hat back

“Everything”

“It is split in three parts, the first part talks about what is left of her, no 
one knows where Leucippe rests” The kid looked intrigued at the statue

“So how do they know that this is how she looked?”

“No one knows, this is an assumption, if you look closely her face has little 
details on her, she is the unknown mother of the world”

“Why is she the mother of the world?”

“Legend says that she gave birth to the first king of all men, if this is true 
then she is mother to all kings and the empress of the world, in other words 
she has given birth to all of those who control the world”

“But aren’t those bad people?”

“Some of them, but the way to hell is paved with good intentions so I can’t tell 
you, you need to use your own judgement, what I can tell you though is that she 
is a vengeful mother and one that does not take lightly on tyranny, she is said 
to have given birth to the first king but also of killing him, the first regicide 
of the world”

“Is that why she carries a spear on her right hand?”

“Most certainly, it is symbolic too you know? To signify that no one is out of 
her reach, that is also why she carries that piece of cloth with her, so that 
all that sees may know that from the very cloth of that same king she killed 
she wrote a letter to the world”

“What does it say?”

“A mothers last wish is the death of her own son, but when her son kills all 
others there is no choice, a mother must do what she will, from her ripped to 
life has come a tyrant and all tyrants must be put to death, by her own hand 
back to other fields to bring health to other wombs, it is by my own hand that 
this and all tyrants are to rest, death to all tyrants”
